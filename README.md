# Fake News Detection

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation for detecting fake news using machine learning techniques. It contains experiments, code, and documentation for developing and evaluating models that differentiate between real and fake news content.

## Project Structure
- **Fake_news_Detection/**: Main project folder containing Jupyter Notebooks and core source code for fake news detection.
- **.idea/**: Project configuration files (auto-generated by IDEs, not central to project logic).

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning tailored for news data.
- Implementation of machine learning models to classify news articles as fake or real.
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive development and demonstration.
- **Python:** Primary programming language for data science and machine learning.
- **Popular ML Libraries:** (Assumed from the project context, e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, numpy).

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shahid-0039/Fake-News-Detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the main folder and open the notebooks:
   ```bash
   cd Fake-News-Detection/Fake_news_Detection
   ```
   Open notebooks in Jupyter Lab or compatible interface.

3. Install dependencies (if requirements.txt exists, otherwise use common ML stack):
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
- Open and run the Jupyter notebooks step by step to understand and reproduce the fake news detection workflow.
- Adjust notebook cells to try different models or preprocess methods.
